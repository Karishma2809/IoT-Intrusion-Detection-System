This repository contains the project files for the "Developing an Intrusion Detection System for IoT Networks," a comprehensive approach to enhancing cybersecurity measures in the realm of Internet of Things (IoT). Our project utilizes advanced machine learning techniques to detect and mitigate sophisticated network attacks, ensuring the integrity and reliability of IoT infrastructures.

### Project Overview
As IoT devices proliferate, the network becomes increasingly susceptible to cyber threats due to inherent vulnerabilities. This project develops a robust IDS tailored specifically for IoT networks, capable of analyzing complex traffic patterns and identifying anomalies in real time.

### Motivation
The necessity to protect IoT networks against an evolving threat landscape has never been more critical. Our IDS aims to provide a scalable and adaptable security solution that not only addresses current threats but is also capable of adapting to future challenges.

### Features
Data Analysis: In-depth analysis of IoT network traffic using Python and various libraries.
Visualization: Utilizes Matplotlib and Seaborn to visualize and understand the data effectively.
Machine Learning Models: Implementation of several machine learning models to predict and classify different types of cyber attacks.
Model Evaluation: Detailed evaluation of model performances with accuracy metrics and confusion matrices.

### Models
Model: K-means Clustering, Logistic Regression, KNN, Support Vector Machines, Naive Bayes, and LDA


### Results
The Logistic Regression model achieved an accuracy of 94.09% on our test set, demonstrating its efficacy in classifying network traffic.
